Instructions:

1.) Go to the Tonal/sqlScripts folder.
2.) In PostgreSql run the scripts in the following order
a.) dbInit.sql
b.) dateTriggers.sql
c.) dataInit.sql

3.) Open Tonal/db_config.txt. This has the postgres connection string that is required to connect to Postgres.
	I didnt use environment variables as i didnt know if there was any security in place on whoevers machine 
	will be running this to stop it or if they didnt want any set on their machine. Ideally these would be environment variables
	
4.) Run core.go - a print out in the terminal will say "server running"

5.) Using postman or some other tool set up your Get Request. In it you will need a cookie with the vlaue of userId=1.
	In lieu of actual tokens and authentication I use the user id to determine if a request can be handled. If you use 
	userId=1 it will work. Any other userId will return an error.
	
6.) The path for the request is /musclegroupexercises/{type}/{name}, where
a.) type is either exercises or musclegroups depending on what you are searching for. 
	E.g. If you are looking for the muscle groups for an exercise the path is /musclegroupexercises/musclegroups/{exerciseName}
b.) name is then the name of the search term. 
	E.g. If you want all the exercises for Forearms the path would be /musclegroupexercises/exercises/Forearms
	
7.) Results, whether valid or error, should be returned in json format. 
a.) Valid returns come in the form '{"name": "{name}", "resultList": [array of items]"}' E.g. {"name":"Forearms","resultList":["Biceps Curl","Triceps Extension","Shoulder Shrug","Pull Up","Deadlift"]}
b. Errors are returned in the form {"error": "You are not authorized to use this service"}
